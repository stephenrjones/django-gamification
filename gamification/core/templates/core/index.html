            <h1>Gamification Server</h1>
            <p>The Gamification Server is a management tool that allows other web pages, apps, or tools to
                utilize "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification" target=_new">Gamification</a>" concepts.  These ideas
                have been found to help engage with some users and encourage teamwork. This is a prototype concept used to integrate
                tools and test out concepts. Interfaces are available either through this web interface or through a REST-based API
                calls.</p>
            <p>The source code for this server is Open Source and currently available on <a href="https://github.com/stephenrjones/django-gamification" target="_new">GitHub</a>
                and available for anyone to use and improve upon. We encourage your participation and want to hear your ideas!
